# Roadmap

Updated: **2026-08-16**

Release history lives in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md); this file tracks incomplete work only.

## Next — ordered by value

1. **Automated Kick DOM drift snapshots.** Add a maintainer-only reducer that turns fresh MHTML/live captures into small, sanitized fixtures and fails when stable probes disappear on Home, Browse, Following, Drops, Search, Category, Channel, or the open sticker picker. Keep raw captures ignored.

## Explicitly deferred

- Full mobile-site support; the settings surface still reflows at narrow window sizes
- Publishing to a userscript catalog or extension store without explicit approval

## Research-Driven Additions

Added 2026-08-15 from the research pass recorded in [RESEARCH.md](RESEARCH.md).

### API and emote-catalog work (added 2026-08-15 from the Kick API + emote tooling research)

Gate for this whole group: do not replay private endpoints or infer entitlement. Data features read endpoints the page already calls, same-origin, inheriting the user's own session, and keep the existing DOM path as fallback. The separately documented click-to-save flow may perform Kick's normal Follow request only after a deliberate click and explicit follow-gate evidence.

## Research-Driven Additions — differential pass

Added 2026-08-15 from the differential research pass recorded in [RESEARCH.md](RESEARCH.md), run against v1.5.0.

## Research-Driven Additions — 2026-08-16 (v1.9.0 pass)

Added from the exhaustive research recorded in [RESEARCH.md](RESEARCH.md), run against v1.9.0. Continues the R-NN scheme (new here — the prior sections were left empty).

Cross-references to existing "Next" items: R-01 unblocks Next items 1, 4, and 5 (all need a real browser); R-09 supersedes Next item 2 (see inline note there); R-14 pairs with Next item 4. New selector dependencies added by R-06/R-07/R-16/R-19 (chat container, header control, discovery cards) should be registered with Next item 3's DOM-drift snapshots as they land.
Previously-blocked items now actionable: telemetry contradiction (R-08 — external evidence now stands in for the multi-hour measurement), stitched-ad observability (R-09 — via the player-events path, not the worker wrapper).

### P0 — data safety, security, correctness, and the single unblock

### P1 — operator demand first, then trust / reliability / accessibility

### P2 — quick wins, operator second-wave, platform modernization, dev-experience

### P3 — differentiators, larger bets, future-proofing
